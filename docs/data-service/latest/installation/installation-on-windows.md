Download NSSM - the Non-Sucking Service Manager in this link:<https://nssm.cc/download>. It’s required to run DataService as a Windows service. Whenever your system is restarted, the NSSM helps us to run DataService again without manual logging in to start it.

Extract files to: C:\akaBot\DataService\nssm\win64\nssm.exe

Make sure %JAVA\_HOME% is set to the path of the correct JDK.

### **4.2. MS SQL Server**

To run DataService on top of Microsoft SQL Server, system administrators need to manually create these schemas on your database: *akabot\_dataservice, akabot\_userdata.*

Then, we need to edit file *C:\akaBot\DataService\application.yml* as the following sample.

* Change the properties to match with your database system: *localhost, port, username, password.*
* *base-url* is the public address of DataService. Can be IP address or domain name.
* *center.domain* is the public address of akaBot Center.
