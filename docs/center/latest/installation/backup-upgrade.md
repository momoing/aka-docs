**Step 6:** Copy the file war ( latest version of Center ) and Start **Tomcat** to proceed to upgrade Center.

**Step 7:** Copy 2 files: **application-dev.yml** and **application-prod.yml** and paste them into the directory below after starting Tomcat (If you config these files).

C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.5\webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\classes\config

**Step 8:** Copy the backup license  and paste into the old folder. (Because the license would be disappeared after upgrading. If you follow this step, you don't need to activate the Center again).
